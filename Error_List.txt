#File documenting known errors and potential areas for improvement

Note: Several of these errors/improvements were not fixed when writing the code due to time constraints/alternative prorities during my MSci Project.

Errors:
  Marching Cubes Algorithm:
    1) Error when running Check_Isosurface_Coordinates() and Check_Traingles() at the same time within Marching_Cubes_for_Single_Cube_Test()
          Currently run one function, output result and then input result to run second function to ensure both have been checked
    2) Find_Common_Interface() doesn't produce desired output
          Results required were acheived manually when writing paper to save time
 
 Improvements
   General:
      1) Create application .exe file so code can be run from app and not compiler
      2) Create proper error handling protocol rather than using exit()
      3) General refactoring
      4) General improvements in comments =)
  Surface Smoothing Algorithm:
      1) Oversmoothing issue causes unsatisfactory results - work on maths behind algorithm requried
